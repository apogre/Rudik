	We present \krd, a system for the discovery of declarative rules over knowledge-bases (KBs).

	and
	%%%%%%%%%JOURNAL. On the contrary, it discovers also 
	{\em negative rules}, i.e., patterns that lead to contradictions in the data, such as ``if two persons are married, one cannot be the child of the other". While the former class

	%%%%%%%%%JOURNAL, or the creation of negative examples to bootstrap learning algorithms.
	%
	The system %%%%%%%%%JOURNALto discover positive and negative rules 
	is designed to: %%%%%%%%%JOURNALwith three main requirements: 
	\begin{inparaenum}[\itshape(i)]
		\item enlarge the {\em expressive power} of the rule language to 
		%comparisons among constants, including disequalities, and therefore 
		obtain complex rules and wide coverage of the facts in the KB, 
		\item allow the discovery of {\em approximate} rules to be robust to errors and incompleteness in the KB, 
		\item use disk-based algorithms, effectively 
		%dropping the assumption that the KB has to fit in memory and
		%have acceptable performance and 
		enabling the mining of large KBs in commodity machines.
	\end{inparaenum}
	%, therefore . 
	%To guarantee that the entire search space is explored, we formalize the mining problem as an incremental graph exploration. 
	%Our novel search strategy is coupled with a number of optimization techniques to further prune and efficiently maintain the search space. 
	%
	%Finally, in contrast with traditional ranking of rules based on a measure of support, we propose a new approach inspired by set cover to identify the subset of useful rules to be exposed to the user. 
	%
	We have conducted extensive experiments using real-world KBs to show that \krd outperforms previous proposals in terms of efficiency and that it discovers more effective rules for the application at hand.
