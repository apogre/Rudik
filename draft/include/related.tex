~\cite{zhu2011mining} -- Jiawei's work, discover of future autorship relations from DBLP (Vamsi?).

~\cite{abedjan2014amending} -- induction of new facts at instance level, rather than being generic and induce rules with variables. Discover much less new instances (2K vs our 100K on Yago2), and even the precision does not look great. Probably not worth to compare against them, just mention.

ALEPH~\cite{muggleton1995inverse}, WARMR~\cite{dehaspe1999discovery}, and SHERLOCK~\cite{schoenmackers2010learning} -- Inductive Logic Programming approaches (outperformed by AMIE).
