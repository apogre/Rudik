Horn Rule, with the restriction of having each variables appearing twice.
Extension of predicates with inequalities.

\subsection{Coverage}
Given a set of examples, talk about coverage and relative coverage of a rule.

\subsection{Scoring Function}
Given a generation and a validation set, define score for a rule and cumulative score for a set of rules.

\subsection{Problem Definition}
Introduce red-blue set cover as a possible solutio, and say why it is not appropriate.
Define the problem as computing the set that miminizes the cumulative scoring function.
