\section{A* Greedy Algorithm}
Justify the use of a greedy algorithm: generating all the rules is very expensive. Better if we can prove that the minimization function algorithm is NP hard.

\subsection{Optimality}
Define property on why the A* algorithm produces the greedy solution.
Maybe study when the greedy solution become optimal? (If all rules identify disjoint set of input example, then greedy solution is optimal)
