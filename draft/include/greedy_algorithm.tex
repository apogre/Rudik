\section{A* Greedy Algorithm} \label{sec:greedy_alg}
Since the universe of all possible rules $R$ is too big to enumerate, we solve the online variant of the above problem. \paolo{if offline problem is NP, online is at least NP; to be verified} \stefano{Shouldn't we just say that the problem is NP therefore we go for a greedy algorithm that allows also to avoid the enumeration of all rules?}

\subsection{Optimality}
Define property on why the A* algorithm produces the greedy solution.
Maybe study when the greedy solution become optimal? (If all rules identify disjoint set of input example, then greedy solution is optimal)
